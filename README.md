# Student Marketplace and Community Engagement Platform for Networking

Project Duration: August 2022 â€“ December 2022

This project is a full-stack community platform designed to increase student engagement on campus by providing a marketplace, networking opportunities, and student club management. The platform enables students to buy, sell, and exchange goods and services while also promoting campus events and providing a way for students to create and join clubs. The project resulted in a 30% increase in campus engagement and helped the university generate additional revenue through advertising.

Key Features:

- Student Marketplace: Allows students to list and browse items or services available for sale or exchange within the campus community.
- Community Engagement: Promotes events, student organizations, and networking opportunities to foster better connections within the campus.
- Clubs Feature: Students can create clubs, join existing ones, and participate in group activities and events related to their interests.
- Revenue Generation: Integrated an advertising system, enabling the university to monetize the platform and boost revenue.
- User-Friendly Interface: A responsive and intuitive front-end built using React.js ensures seamless navigation and interaction.
- Backend and APIs: Built with PHP Laravel to handle business logic, user authentication, and data management, with REST APIs enabling smooth communication between the frontend and backend.
- Database Management: The platform uses MySQL to manage user data, listings, transactions, and club-related information securely and efficiently.

Tech Stack:
